Project 3: Spots

Intro

This project was created as part of Practicum’s Frontend Developer program. The goal of Spots is to practice adaptive and responsive web design using modern HTML and CSS techniques. The website presents a clean, minimal layout that adapts gracefully to various screen sizes — from large desktops to small mobile devices.

Figma

Images

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
